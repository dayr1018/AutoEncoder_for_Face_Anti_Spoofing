# Auto-Encoder for Face Anti-Spoofing

Welcome to the Repository for Auto-Encoder for Face Anti-Spoofing. This repository is for experimenting with face anti-spoofing abnomaly detection model implemented with auto-encoder. This expeirments were motivated from ***"Use of in-the-wild images for anomaly detection in face anti-spoofing(arxiv, 2020)"*** The paper proposed auto-encoder with RGB images. But herein, I tried auto-encoder with RGB and Depth. [Face Dataset was obtained from AI Hub](https://aihub.or.kr/aihubdata/data/view.do?currMenu=115&topMenu=100&aihubDataSe=realm&dataSetSn=161).


# Architecture of Auto-Encoder

**[Fisrt Approach - Basic]**

**[Second Approach - with Gaussian Noise]**
